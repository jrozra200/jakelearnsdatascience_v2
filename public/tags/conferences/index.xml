      <description>I went to a data event last night called the Data Jawn, presented by RJMetrics, and wanted to share a write up of the event – it was pretty cool and sparked some really good ideas.
One idea I really liked – Predicting who will call in/have an issue and proactively reaching out to them… Sounds like a game changer to me. I could then trigger alerts when we see that activity or make a list for reaching out via phone, email, text… whatever.</description>
