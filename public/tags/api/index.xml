      <title>Using R and Splunk: Lookups of More Than 10,000 Results</title>

      <description>Splunk, for some probably very good reasons, has limits on how many results are returned by sub-searches (which in turn limits us on lookups, too). Because of this, I’ve used R to search Splunk through it’s API endpoints (using the httr package) and utilize loops, the plyr package, and other data manipulation flexibilities given through the use of R.
This has allowed me to answer some questions for our business team that at the surface seem simple enough, but the data gathering and manipulation get either too complex or large for Splunk to handle efficiently.</description>

      <description>I’ve got a buddy who manages and builds waterparks. I thought to myself… I am probably the only person in the world who has a friend that works at a waterpark - cool. Then I started thinking some more… there has to be more than just his waterpark in this country; I’ve been to at least a few… and the thinking continued… I wonder how many there are… and continued… and I wonder where they are… and, well, here we are at the culmination of that curiosity with this blog post.</description>
