      <description>I found a very thought provoking and beautiful visualization on the D3 Website regarding prime numbers. What the visualization shows is that if you draw periodic curves beginning at the origin for each positive integer, the prime numbers will be intersected by only two curves: the prime itself&amp;rsquo;s curve and the curve for one.
When I saw this, my mind was blown. How interesting&amp;hellip; and also how obvious. The definition of a prime is that it can only be divided by itself and one (duh).</description>

      <description>A demonstration D3 project, shamelessly ripping off Gapminder.</description>

      <description>For those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t stirred from bed in the small hours to learn data science, you might have missed that March 5th was international open data day. There are hundreds of local events around the world; I was lucky enough to attend DC&amp;rsquo;s Open Data Day Hackathon. I met a bunch of great people doing noble things with data who taught me a crap-ton (scientific term) and also validated my love for data science and how much I&amp;rsquo;ve learned since beginning my journey almost two years ago.</description>
