      <description>INTRODUCTION My wife introduced me to cycling in 2014 - I fell in love with it and went all in. That first summer after buying my bike, I rode over 500 miles (more on that below). My neighbors at the time, also cyclists, introduced me to the app Strava. Ever since then, I’ve tracked all of my rides, runs, hikes, walks (perhaps not really exercise that needs to be tracked… but I hurt myself early in 2018 and that’s all I could do for a while), etc.</description>

      <title>Prime Number Patterns</title>

      <description>I found a very thought provoking and beautiful visualization on the D3 Website regarding prime numbers. What the visualization shows is that if you draw periodic curves beginning at the origin for each positive integer, the prime numbers will be intersected by only two curves: the prime itself&amp;rsquo;s curve and the curve for one.
When I saw this, my mind was blown. How interesting&amp;hellip; and also how obvious. The definition of a prime is that it can only be divided by itself and one (duh).</description>

      <title>Exploring Open Data - Philadelphia Parking Violations</title>

      <description>Introduction A few weeks ago, I stumbled across Dylan Purcell&amp;rsquo;s article on Philadelphia Parking Violations. This is a nice glimpse of the data, but I wanted to get a taste of it myself. I went and downloaded the entire data set of Parking Violations in Philadelphia from the OpenDataPhilly website and came up with a few questions after checking out the data:
How many tickets in the data set?
 What is the range of dates in the data?</description>

      <description>For those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t stirred from bed in the small hours to learn data science, you might have missed that March 5th was international open data day. There are hundreds of local events around the world; I was lucky enough to attend DC&amp;rsquo;s Open Data Day Hackathon. I met a bunch of great people doing noble things with data who taught me a crap-ton (scientific term) and also validated my love for data science and how much I&amp;rsquo;ve learned since beginning my journey almost two years ago.</description>

      <title>Using the Google Search API and Plotly to Locate Waterparks</title>
      <link>/post/waterparks-with-the-google-search-api-and-plotly/</link>

      <description>I’ve got a buddy who manages and builds waterparks. I thought to myself… I am probably the only person in the world who has a friend that works at a waterpark - cool. Then I started thinking some more… there has to be more than just his waterpark in this country; I’ve been to at least a few… and the thinking continued… I wonder how many there are… and continued… and I wonder where they are… and, well, here we are at the culmination of that curiosity with this blog post.</description>
