      <description>I found a very thought provoking and beautiful visualization on the D3 Website regarding prime numbers. What the visualization shows is that if you draw periodic curves beginning at the origin for each positive integer, the prime numbers will be intersected by only two curves: the prime itself&amp;rsquo;s curve and the curve for one.
When I saw this, my mind was blown. How interesting&amp;hellip; and also how obvious. The definition of a prime is that it can only be divided by itself and one (duh).</description>

      <description>I’ve got a buddy who manages and builds waterparks. I thought to myself… I am probably the only person in the world who has a friend that works at a waterpark - cool. Then I started thinking some more… there has to be more than just his waterpark in this country; I’ve been to at least a few… and the thinking continued… I wonder how many there are… and continued… and I wonder where they are… and, well, here we are at the culmination of that curiosity with this blog post.</description>
