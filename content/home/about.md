# Background

I love to learn in general, but mostly I am a data fanatic - I love reading, 
writing, and learning about all things data: science, analysis, and visualizations.

I fell in love with data when I got a gig as a data analyst for Comcast's 
Xfinity Connect residential email team in 2014 after 5 years as a project manager. 
In that role, I was responsible for detecting compromised user accounts that 
were being used abusively. While I was still very new to data, I did manage to implement 
some cool detection algorithms some pretty creative ways.

From there, I moved to Xfinity Mobile's Risk Management team in 2017. I focused 
initially on the detection and remediation of fraudulent purchases along with 
reporting. Combining data engineering, analytics, and science, I (along with a 
great team) built real-time fraud detection algorithms that significantly 
reduced our fraud exposure. After that, I shifted focus from fraud to credit - 
learning the ins and outs of lending. I spent my time baselining (building 
out our reporting suite) and forecasting performance based on our evolving 
strategy changes.

Most recently, I have made the move from Comcast to Socure as a Solutions 
Consultant. I am a technical expert on fraud prevention, Know Your Customer 
(KYC)/Customer Identification Program (CIP), Socure product modules, data 
science, statistics, data visualization, and proof of concept presentations in 
support of the sales and onboarding processes.

In addition to data, I love being the father of 2 fantastic children and husband 
to a remarkable woman.
