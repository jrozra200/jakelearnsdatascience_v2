I love to learn in general, but mostly I am a data fanatic - I love reading, 
writing, and learning about all things data: science, analysis, and visualizations.

# Background

I fell in love with data when I got a gig as a data analyst for Comcast's 
Xfinity Connect residential email team in 2014 after 5 years as a project manager. 
In that role, I was responsible for detecting compromised user accounts that 
were being used abusively - sending spam and doing other nefarious things with 
Comcast accounts. While I was still very new to data, I did manage to implement 
some cool detection algorithms in a pretty creative way - I implemented a 
logistic regression in Splunk. That process is still in production today, though 
the team has since made it way better!

From there, I moved internally to Xfinity Mobile's (XM) Risk Management team - 
this was in early 2017. Currently in this role, I focused initially on the 
detection and remediation of fraudulent purchases - along with reporting. 
Combining data engineering, analytics, and science, I (along with a great team) 
built a tool that combines feature creation, statistically and
business-based rules, and predictive models in real-time to allow the best 
customer experience while purchasing phones in all sales channels.

I have recently shifted focus from fraud to credit - learning the ins and outs 
of lending. So far in the new focus, I have spent my time baselining (building 
out our reporting suite) and forecasting performance based on our evolving 
strategy changes.

In addition to data, I love being the father of 2 fantastic children and husband 
to a remarkable woman.
